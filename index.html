        <h4><a href="https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2018/10/rethinkweb/">Rethink: Web (Series Intro)</a></h4>
        <ul>
          <li><p>When we struggle to explain the inherent qualities of a medium, we tend to defer to analogies and metaphors. This is especially true of the internet. Clouds, highways, streams, and real estate are just a few examples of the concepts employed to represent this intangible invention. Staring into a screen, it&rsquo;s easy to imagine an expanse behind the glass, a limitless space where these metaphors unfold, when in reality it is only as extensive as the material from which it&rsquo;s made.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2018/07/the-absolute-denial-of-%F0%9F%92%A9/">The Absolute Denial of ðŸ’©</a></h4>
        <ul>
          <li><p>If emoji are to become adequate vehicles for discussing public health, the legal system, and art, their depictions need to be molded by users rather than a handful of software companies. When language is subjugated to corporate interests, we lose our ability to talk honestly and openly about the world, and some uncomfortable and disturbing juxtapositions emerge.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/read/sfmoma-net-neutrality/">SFMOMA + Net Neutrality</a></h4>
        <ul>
          <li><p>The web today is widely regarded as an engine of commerce, but its origins were born in 1991 from a scientist&rsquo;s desire to facilitate open collaboration among researchers. The web is meant to be contributed to, as much as it is meant to be consumed. When looked at through the lens of collaboration rather than commerce, providing equitable access to content and media seems a natural, logical way to further public knowledge and understanding.</p>

        <h4><a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/read/sending-send-me-sfmoma-abroad/">Sending &ldquo;Send Me SFMOMA&rdquo; Abroad</a></h4>
        <ul>
          <li><p>After Send Me SFMOMA went viral in July, appearing in news outlets around the world, the interest in making the service available to international audiences was resounding. SFMOMA&rsquo;s tweet about an international rollout is the most popular in the museum&rsquo;s history. As interest mounted, our thinking turned to the broader philosophy that guided the project&rsquo;s inception. As an exercise in transparency meant to engender discussion about SFMOMA&rsquo;s collection, this project has clearly succeeded. How, then, would making Send Me SFMOMA internationally available enhance the spirit of the project?</p>

				<ul>
					<li>
            <p>Send Me SFMOMA was conceived as a way to bring transparency to the collection while engendering further exploration and discussion among users. Send Me SFMOMA is an SMS service that provides an approachable, personal, and creative method of sharing the breadth of SFMOMA&rsquo;s collection with the public.</p>
          
            <p>Text 572-51 with the words &ldquo;send me&rdquo; followed by a keyword, a color, or even an emoji and you&rsquo;ll receive a related artwork image and caption via text message.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>&ldquo;Newer technology is often inaccessible to wider audiences. However there is an ambient use of technology in our everyday lives, and while it may seem mundane, I believe it is worth reexamining its use and the structural consequences it has on how we explore, learn and proliferate ideas.&rdquo;</li>
