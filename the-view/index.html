      <ul>
        <li><a href="view-1/">View #1</a></li>
        <li><a href="view-2/">View #2</a></li>
        <li><a href="view-3/">View #3</a></li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Process</h2>
      <p>For the initial concept, I drew upon <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Poetics_of_Space" target="_blank"><i>The Poetics of Space</i></a> by Gaston Bachelard, a book I recently read that places emphasis on the lived-experiences of spaces rather than their structural or historical origins. Ellsworth Kelly&rsquo;s depiction of <a href="https://sfmoma.org/artwork/99.347/" target="_blank">shadows cast through a railing</a> inspired me to use my (quite limited) view as the foundation of an exercise in geometric abstraction.</p>
      <p>The form and palette of each view were meant to convey key principles of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gestalt_psychology#Properties" target="_blank">gestaltism</a>: reification, multistability and invariance.</p>
      <p>Interactions were meant to foreground the &ldquo;user as performer&rdquo; concepts outlined in the work of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muriel_Cooper" target="_blank">Muriel Cooper</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brenda_Laurel" target="_blank">Brenda Laurel&rsquo;s</a> <i>Computers As Theater</i>.
      <p>The colors were inspired by a recent trip to Mexico City and the Endless Summer album cover.</p>

      <h2>Set up</h2>
      <p><i>The View</i> is a static web app, so you can download the files, <code>cd root/of/project</code> and execute <code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code>. It is also hosted at <a href="https://jaymollica.github.io/the-view/">jaymollica.github.io/the-view/</a>.</p>
      <h2>Structure</h2>
      <p>The project is structured in such a way that each view can act as a stand-alone site. There is some redundancy when constructing the views (esp #2 and #3), but I felt this modular approach best serves the spirit of the project. Mostly this is vanilla JS with minimal CSS / HTML. To save some time, I used <a href="https://github.com/bit101/tones" target="_blank">tones.js</a> in View #2 to wire up the audio interaction.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="view-1/">View #1</a> - this is the most minimal of the three. I didn't have the time to wire up an interaction.</li>
        <li><a href="view-2/">View #2</a> (start here) - this is the most developed of the three. On desktop mousing over the browser window will trigger a tone and change in colors. On mobile a gyroscope event will change the colors.</li>
        <li><a href="view-3/">View #3</a> - this is a generative piece where three partial iterations of the view converge in the mind to form the whole of the view.</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Next steps</h2>
      <p>Due to time constraints, I didn't have the opportunity to wire up an interaction for each view. Though there are currently three views, this project could grow into a portfolio of &ldquo;micro-interactions&rdquo; each with its own isolated exploration of a browser / mobile / or otherwise digital interaction. I see this project as a sort of spiritual successor to <a href="https://www.sfmoma.org/artist/John_Maeda/" target="_blank">John Maeda&rsquo;s</a> <i>Reactive Books</i> series, which explores the subtleties of human-computer interaction and how the rapid development of digital tools has changed how we work.</p>
      <h2>End note</h2>
      <p>I really enjoyed this exercise and I plan on continuing to develop this project in the future. In my previous role at SFMOMA, I organized and lead <i>Rethink: Web</i>, a workshop exploring ways the web could better foster exploration, expression and connectivity. My intro to the project can be found on <a href="https://openspace.sfmoma.org/2018/10/rethinkweb/" target="_blank">Open Space</a>. Thanks for reading!</p>
